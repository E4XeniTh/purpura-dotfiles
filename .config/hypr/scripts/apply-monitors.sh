# Replays the monitor layout saved by the quickshell Screen settings panel
# (components/dashboard/settings/ScreenSettings.qml), one hyprctl eval
# call per monitor entry's precomputed "line" field - each one is already
# a full "hl.monitor({ ... })" Lua expression, since that's what
# ScreenSettings.qml itself writes into every entry on Apply. This config
# is parsed by hyprlang's Lua frontend, which rejects `hyprctl keyword`
# outright ("keyword can't work with non-legacy parsers. Use eval."), so
# `eval` is the only working write path here.
#
# Lives under quickshell's own config dir (not hypr's) since that panel
# is the only thing that reads or writes it - one JSON file combining
# what used to be a separate monitors.conf (this script's input) and
# screens.json (remembered per-monitor geometry, used only by the QML
# side).
#
# Run once at startup (see hyprland.lua's autostart block) so a layout
# built through the settings panel survives a restart - hyprland.lua
# itself only defines the primary display now.
